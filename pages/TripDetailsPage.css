  Ensure icons that might rely on text color also turn white,
  but allow specific status colors (like stars or success messages) to retain their color if needed.
  However, the user request was "all text elements display in white color".
  We will stick to the strict override for text.

/* 
  Re-apply color to inputs so they are readable against their backgrounds if needed, 
  but the user asked for "All visible text... in pure white".
  We will assume this includes inputs unless it breaks usability (white on white).
  For safety, we'll keep inputs white, assuming backgrounds are dark as per existing design (bg-surface-dark).
